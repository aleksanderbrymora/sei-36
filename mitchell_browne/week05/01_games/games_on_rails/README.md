# Games on Rails

Games on Rails is a web application with three games

* Magic 8 Ball
* Secret Number
* Rock Paper Scissors

__Magic 8 Ball__

* Magic 8 ball takes user's questions from the the URL as params and returns a positive or negative answer.

__Secret Number__

* Users click a number between 1 and 10. The controller validates the guess and renders the win or lose view.

__Rock Paper Scissors__

* Create a route that goes from ```/games/rock_paper_scissors/:throw``` to ```games#rock_paper_scissors_play```
* Use params[:throw] as a user's choice
* Compare the 2! If  users throw matches the apps throw, the user wins.
* i.e. If a user throws rock ```http://localhost:3000/games/rock_paper_scissors/rock``` and the server picks rock player wins! (Yes,  I know that is not how RPS works)
Bonus: Set the win or lose condition based on the real rules of [Rock Paper Scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).
