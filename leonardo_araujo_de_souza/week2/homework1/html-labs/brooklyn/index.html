	<p> Wouldn’t necessarily call myself a big ~planner~, but when it comes to keeping an eye out for upcoming trends, I like to think I’m pretty capable. I mean, I’m the sort of person who plans her fall wardrobe in spring, so you know I’ve already got my eye on what trends we can all expect in the new year. While, of course, everything is a bit of a guessing game, checking out designer runways can help predict the 2020 fashion trends. (Plus, they’re just fun to peruse for outfit inspiration.) If you didn’t really pay much attention to the 2019 runway shows, have no fear. I took a good, long look at what designers will be offering in the next year and put together a list of 12 different trends we’ll all see throughout 2020.</p>
