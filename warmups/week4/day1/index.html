			E Americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell us
			the secret of success in life; yet how often we are disappointed to find
			nothing but commonplace statements, or receipts that we know by heart but
			never follow. Most of the life stories of our famous and successful men
			fail to inspire because they lack the human element that makes the record
			real and brings the story within our grasp. While we are searching far and
			near for some Aladdin's Lamp to give coveted fortune, there is ready at
			our hand if we will only reach out and take it, like the charm in Milton's
			Comus, "Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain Treads on it daily
			with his clouted shoon;" the interesting, human, and vividly told story of
			one of the wisest and most useful lives in our own history, and perhaps in
			any history. In Franklin's Autobiography is offered not so much a
			ready-made formula for success, as the companionship of a real flesh and
			blood man of extraordinary mind and quality, whose daily walk and
			conversation will help us to meet our own difficulties, much as does the
			example of a wise and strong friend. While we are fascinated by the story,
			we absorb the human experience through which a strong and helpful
			character is building. The thing that makes Franklin's Autobiography
			different from every other life story of a great and successful man is
			just this human aspect of the account. Franklin told the story of his
			life, as he himself says, for the benefit of his posterity. He wanted to
			help them by the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to
			eminence and wealth. He is not unmindful of the importance of his public
			services and their recognition, yet his accounts of these achievements are
			given only as a part of the story, and the vanity displayed is incidental
			and in keeping with the honesty of the recital. There is nothing of the
			impossible in the method and practice of Franklin as he sets them forth.
			The youth who reads the fascinating story is astonished to find that
			Franklin in his early years struggled with the same everyday passions and
			difficulties that he himself experiences, and he loses the sense of
			discouragement that comes from a realization of his own shortcomings and
			inability to attain. There are other reasons why the Autobiography should
			be an intimate friend of American young people. Here they may establish a
			close relationship with one of the foremost Americans as well as one of
			the wisest men of his age. The life of Benjamin Franklin is of importance
			to every American primarily because of the part he played in securing the
			independence of the United States and in establishing it as a nation.
			Franklin shares with Washington the honors of the Revolution, and of the
			events leading to the birth of the new nation. While Washington was the
			animating spirit of the struggle in the colonies, Franklin was its ablest
			champion abroad. To Franklin's cogent reasoning and keen satire, we owe
			the clear and forcible presentation of the American case in England and
			France; while to his personality and diplomacy as well as to his facile
			pen, we are indebted for the foreign alliance and the funds without which
			Washington's work must have failed. His patience, fortitude, and practical
			wisdom, coupled with self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of his
			country, are hardly less noticeable than similar qualities displayed by
			Washington. In fact, Franklin as a public man was much like Washington,
			especially in the entire disinterestedness of his public service. Franklin
			is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings he has done
			more than any other American to advance the material prosperity of his
			countrymen. It is said that his widely and faithfully read maxims made
			Philadelphia and Pennsylvania wealthy, while Poor Richard's pithy sayings,
			translated into many languages, have had a world-wide influence. Franklin
			is a good type of our American manhood. Although not the wealthiest or the
			most powerful, he is undoubtedly, in the versatility of his genius and
			achievements, the greatest of our self-made men. The simple yet graphic
			story in the Autobiography of his steady rise from humble boyhood in a
			tallow-chandler shop, by industry, economy, and perseverance in
			self-improvement, to eminence, is the most remarkable of all the
			remarkable histories of our self-made men. It is in itself a wonderful
			illustration of the results possible to be attained in a land of unequaled
			opportunity by following Franklin's maxims. Franklin's fame, however, was
			not confined to his own country. Although he lived in a century notable
			for the rapid evolution of scientific and political thought and activity,
			yet no less a keen judge and critic than Lord Jeffrey, the famous editor
			of the Edinburgh Review, a century ago said that "in one point of view the
			name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of the
			others which illustrated the eighteenth century. Distinguished as a
			statesman, he was equally great as a philosopher, thus uniting in himself
			a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits, to excel in either of
			which is deemed the highest praise." Franklin has indeed been aptly called
			"many-sided." He was eminent in science and public service, in diplomacy
			and in literature. He was the Edison of his day, turning his scientific
			discoveries to the benefit of his fellow-men. He perceived the identity of
			lightning and electricity and set up the lightning rod. He invented the
			Franklin stove, still widely used, and refused to patent it. He possessed
			a masterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs. Carlyle called
			him the father of all the Yankees. He founded a fire company, assisted in
			founding a hospital, and improved the cleaning and lighting of streets. He
			developed journalism, established the American Philosophical Society, the
			public library in Philadelphia, and the University of Pennsylvania. He
			organized a postal system for the colonies, which was the basis of the
			present United States Post Office. Bancroft, the eminent historian, called
			him "the greatest diplomatist of his century." He perfected the Albany
			Plan of Union for the colonies. He is the only statesman who signed the
			Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the
			Treaty of Peace with England, and the Constitution. As a writer, he has
			produced, in his Autobiography and in Poor Richard's Almanac, two works
			that are not surpassed by similar writing. He received honorary degrees
			from Harvard and Yale, from Oxford and St. Andrews, and was made a fellow
			of the Royal Society, which awarded him the Copley gold medal for
			improving natural knowledge. He was one of the eight foreign associates of
			the French Academy of Science. The careful study of the Autobiography is
			also valuable because of the style in which it is written. If Robert Louis
			Stevenson is right in believing that his remarkable style was acquired by
			imitation then the youth who would gain the power to express his ideas
			clearly, forcibly, and interestingly cannot do better than to study
			Franklin's method. Franklin's fame in the scientific world was due almost
			as much to his modest, simple, and sincere manner of presenting his
			discoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which he
			described his experiments, as to the results he was able to announce. Sir
			Humphry Davy, the celebrated English chemist, himself an excellent
			literary critic as well as a great scientist, said: "A singular felicity
			guided all Franklin's researches, and by very small means he established
			very grand truths. The style and manner of his publication on electricity
			are almost as worthy of admiration as the doctrine it contains."
			Franklin's place in literature is hard to determine because he was not
			primarily a literary man. His aim in his writings as in his life work was
			to be helpful to his fellow-men. For him writing was never an end in
			itself, but always a means to an end. Yet his success as a scientist, a
			statesman, and a diplomat, as well as socially, was in no little part due
			to his ability as a writer. "His letters charmed all, and made his
			correspondence eagerly sought. His political arguments were the joy of his
			party and the dread of his opponents. His scientific discoveries were
			explained in language at once so simple and so clear that plow-boy and
			exquisite could follow his thought or his experiment to its conclusion."
			[1] As far as American literature is concerned, Franklin has no
			contemporaries. Before the Autobiography only one literary work of
			importance had been produced in this countryâ€”Cotton Mather's Magnalia, a
			church history of New England in a ponderous, stiff style. Franklin was
			the first American author to gain a wide and permanent reputation in
			Europe. The Autobiography, Poor Richard, Father Abraham's Speech or The
			Way to Wealth, as well as some of the Bagatelles, are as widely known
			abroad as any American writings. Franklin must also be classed as the
			first American humorist. English literature of the eighteenth century was
			characterized by the development of prose. Periodical literature reached
			its perfection early in the century in The Tatler and The Spectator of
			Addison and Steele. Pamphleteers flourished throughout the period. The
			homelier prose of Bunyan and Defoe gradually gave place to the more
			elegant and artificial language of Samuel Johnson, who set the standard
			for prose writing from 1745 onward. This century saw the beginnings of the
			modern novel, in Fielding's Tom Jones, Richardson's Clarissa Harlowe,
			Sterne's Tristram Shandy, and Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield. Gibbon wrote
			The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Hume his History of England, and
			Adam Smith the Wealth of Nations. In the simplicity and vigor of his style
			Franklin more nearly resembles the earlier group of writers. In his first
			essays he was not an inferior imitator of Addison. In his numerous
			parables, moral allegories, and apologues he showed Bunyan's influence.
			But Franklin was essentially a journalist. In his swift, terse style, he
			is most like Defoe, who was the first great English journalist and master
			of the newspaper narrative. The style of both writers is marked by homely,
			vigorous expression, satire, burlesque, repartee. Here the comparison must
			end. Defoe and his contemporaries were authors. Their vocation was writing
			and their success rests on the imaginative or creative power they
			displayed. To authorship Franklin laid no claim. He wrote no work of the
			imagination. He developed only incidentally a style in many respects as
			remarkable as that of his English contemporaries. He wrote the best
			autobiography in existence, one of the most widely known collections of
			maxims, and an unsurpassed series of political and social satires, because
			he was a man of unusual scope of power and usefulness, who knew how to
			tell his fellow-men the secrets of that power and that usefulness.
