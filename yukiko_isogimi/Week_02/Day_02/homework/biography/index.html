    <p>Yukihiro <strong>M</strong>atsumoto (まつもとゆきひろ, Matsumoto Yukihiro, a.k.a. Matz, born 14 April 1965) is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its reference implementation, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI). </p>
   <p>His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.As of 2011, <strong>M</strong>atsumoto is the Chief Architect of Ruby at Heroku, an online cloud platform-as-a-service in San Francisco. He is a fellow of Rakuten Institute of Technology, a research and development organisation in Rakuten Inc. </p>
   <p>He was appointed to the role of technical advisor for VASILY, Inc. starting in June 2014.[1]He works for the Japanese open source company, netlab.jp. <strong>M</strong>atsumoto is known as one of the open source evangelists in Japan. He has released several open source products, including cmail, the Emacs-based mail user agent, written entirely in Emacs Lisp. Ruby is his first piece of software that has become known outside Japan.[3]Matsumoto released the first version of the Ruby programming language on 21 December 1995.[4][5] He still leads the development of the language's reference implementation, MRI (for Matz's Ruby Interpreter).In April 2012, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new implementation of Ruby called mruby.[6][7]</p>
   <p>It is a minimal implementation based on his virtual machine, called ritevm, and is designed to allow software developers to embed Ruby in other programs while keeping memory footprint small and performance optimised.In December 2014, <strong>M</strong>atsumoto open-sourced his work on a new scripting language called streem, a concurrent language based on a programming model similar to shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang and other functional programming languages.</p>
