          <h2>Journey to Perl</h2>
          <p>The beginnings of Perl were directly inspired by running into a
              problem I couldn't solve with the tools I had. Or rather, that I
              couldn't easily solve. As the Apostle Paul so succinctly put it,
              “All things are possible, but not all things are expedient.” I could
               have solved my problem with awk and shell eventually, but I possess
              a fortuitous surplus of the three chief virtues of a programmer:
              Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. I was too lazy to do it in awk
              because it would have been hard to get awk to jump through the hoops
              I was wanting it to jump through. I was too impatient to wait for
              awk to finish because it was so slow. And finally, I had the hubris
              to think I could do better. Of course, actually writing something
              like Perl takes a great deal of hard work, patience and even humility.
              Had I just been doing it for myself, I probably wouldn't have made
              the effort. However, I was aware from the beginning that other
              people were going to be using Perl, so I've always integrated the
              “laziness curve” over the whole community, not just over myself.
              I was being vicariously lazy. So here we are talking about vicars
              again. Eventually I came up with the name “pearl”, with the gloss
              Practical Extraction and Report Language. The “a” was still in the
               name when I made that one up. But I heard rumors of some obscure
               graphics language named “pearl”, so I shortened it to “perl”.
               (The “a” had already disappeared by the time I gave Perl its
               alternate gloss, Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.)</p>
               <p>
               <em>In Perl's case, we realized about the time of Perl 4 that it was
               useful to distinguish between “perl” the program and “Perl” the
               language. If you find a first edition of the Camel Book, you'll
               see that the title was Programming perl, with a small “p”.</em>

          <p>Nowadays, the title is Programming Perl.It was designed to evolve, to become
           more adaptive, as they say. Right from the start, Perl was designed
           for change. This involves certain tradeoffs, some of which appear
           to be suboptimal to people who don't think the way I think. For
           instance, I wanted to be able to add new keywords to Perl without
           breaking old programs, so I put them into a separate namespace from
           variable names. This meant either variable names or keywords had to
          be marked somehow as special.Perl better than other scripting
          languages such as Python and Eiffel :</p>
          <p>Perl is unique, not just among scripting languages, but among computer
          languages in general. It's the only computer language consciously and
          explicitly designed to be postmodern.
