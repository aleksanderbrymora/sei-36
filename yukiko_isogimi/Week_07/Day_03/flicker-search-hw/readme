# AJAX Flickr Lab

- Support infinite scroll to show all results from Flickr (eventually, after a lot of scrolling).
- **Prevent your code from making too many requests**: only one at a time, please
- Don't request more images when you reach the last "page" of Flickr results
- Make sure you go back to the first page when searching for a new term!
- Make it beautiful
- Add other features as you see fit
- Bonus: display larger images in an attractive slideshow
- Bonus: add links back to each image's own page on Flic
