        <h1>Grace Hopper- The First Lady of Software</h1>
        <h4>Her Legacy in her words</h4>
        <h6>"The most important thing I’ve accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, ‘Do you think we can do this?’ I say, ‘Try it.’ And I back ’em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir ’em up at intervals, so they don’t forget to take chances."</h6>

        <p>Grace Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was known as the <span>First Lady of Software</span>. For being called the Software Lady, she did a lot of inventions since the age of 7. At the age of 7, when a normal child thinks of playing cricket and dolls, Hopper dismantled her alarm clock to figure out how it works. Such curious and analytical mind she had.</p>
        <p>She was one of the first programmers in the history of computers. She helped develop a compiler that was a pioneer to the widely used COBOL (an acronym for Common Business-Oriented Language) language. <span>It is just because of this Iron Lady’s influence that the programmers are using if/then” instead of 1s and 0s till today</span>.</p>
