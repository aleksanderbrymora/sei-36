<!-- # Array and Functions Bonus Material

1. Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. You'll have to remember your pre-work, or do some googling to figure this out.
2. Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
4. Define a function `sumArray` and a function `multiplyArray` that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, `sumArray([1,2,3,4])` should return 10, and `multiplyArray([1,2,3,4])` should return 24.

## Bonus

5. Define a function `reverseString` that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
6. Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.
7. Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and an number `i` and returns the array of words that are longer than i. -->
