                    <h2>Development of bitcoin</h2>
                    <p>In October 2008, Nakamoto published a paper[8][9] on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com[10] describing the bitcoin digital currency. It was titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". In January 2009, Nakamoto released on Sourceforge version 0.1 of the software that launched the network and the first units of the bitcoin cryptocurrency, called bitcoins.[11][12]</p>

                    <p>Nakamoto claimed that work on the writing of the code began in 2007.[13] Nakamoto knew that due to its nature, the core design would have to be able to support a broad range of transaction types. The implemented solution enabled specialized codes and data fields from the start through the use of a predicative script.</p>

                    <p>Nakamoto created a website with the domain name bitcoin.org and continued to collaborate with other developers on the bitcoin software until mid-2010. Around this time, he handed over control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen,[15] transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his involvement in the project. Until shortly before his absence and handover, Nakamoto made all modifications to the source code himself.</p>

                    <p>Nakamoto has not disclosed any personal information when discussing technical matters.[22] He provided some commentary on banking and fractional-reserve banking. On his P2P Foundation profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old male who lived in Japan,[23] but some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his native-level use of English[22] and his bitcoin software not being documented or labelled in Japanese. Some have considered that Nakamoto might be a team of people: Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who read the bitcoin code,[24] said that Nakamoto could either be a "team of people" or a "genius";[25] Laszlo Hanyecz, a developer who had emailed Nakamoto, had the feeling the code was too well designed for one person.[22] Gavin Andresen has said of Nakamoto's code: "He was a brilliant coder, but it was quirky."[26]</p>
                    <h2>Characteristics and identity</h2>
                    <p>Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. This was between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Japanese time, suggesting an unusual sleep pattern for someone presumably living in Japan. As this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time.[22]</p>

                    <p>Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale,[20] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[21][22] later the Colonnade Hotel.[17][23] Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).[24]</p>

                    <p>Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's childhood years Turing's parents travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom[25] and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.[26] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.[27]</p>

                    <p>Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.[28] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.[29]</p>
