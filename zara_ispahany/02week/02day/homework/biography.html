    <h2>Just random bits from her blog</h2>
    <p>welcome to my blog.</p>
    <p>once upon a time i did a lot of college and then worked at a lot of college but felt like i couldn't thrive as an educator and woman, so i went into the industry in the worst possible space to be if you wanted to thrive as an educator and woman: sports lol</p>
    <p>that's not to say it was an awful job, it just wasn't the kind of place i needed to be to fulfill my drive for facilitating quality education outside of the ivory tower. at the same time i was writing tech satire and becoming the go-to person to talk to about the "intersection of art and code" which was at the time ridiculed by both tech and art communities. now it's only ridiculed by the art world–probably because of tech's aggressive LEARN 2 CODE OR ELSE philosophy–and embraced by tech, proving that cultural shifts in the industry can happen! maybe!</p>
    <p>nowadays we continue to pressure people into learning how to code, yet we foster a toxic culture where people feel they cannot speak up and ask questions like we did when we were first learning. many of us are promoting open web technology and education, but at the same time we are obfuscating our code with frameworks that prevent others from viewing the source. remember viewing source code to learn? there are a lot of vicious cycles spinning in our industry that i honestly feel we can stop before we continue making bad software, promoting a bad culture, and isolating people who just want to thrive in our exciting booming industry.</p>
    <p>anyway, this is technically not a "this is my new job post" because i've been working at fog creek as a community engineer for over a month now. we're working on a cool collaborative in-browser code editor called glitch, which is going to take away the pain of both having to get your app on the internet and of having to do things completely on your own. i've been building cool things with it for you because i want to bring collaborative learning and "view source" back.</p>
    <p>here is the part where i am supposed to tell you why i'm joining fog creek over anyone else but in my own brain it seems totally obvious: my goals for working in the industry were always to champion the open web, promote open source development and education, work in a nice community that stays nice, and make people feel empowered to ask for help when they need it and in return help others. fog creek to me is the gold standard for good software, good culture, and ethical tech, and i look forward to us EMBARKING ON A NEW ADVENTUROUS JOURNEY together.</p>
