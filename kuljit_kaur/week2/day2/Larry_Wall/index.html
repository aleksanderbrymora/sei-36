          <h2>Life Story</h2>
          <p> Larry Wall is the computer programmer responsible for creating Perl,
              a powerful general-purpose programming language known for its strengths
              in text processing. Wall, whose graduate work was in linguistics,
              designed <strong><em>Perl in 1987</em></strong> for reports processing
              and continues to oversee the language's development according to the
              motto "Larry is always right,even when he was wrong." He also originated
              the three canonical "virtues" of a good programmer: laziness, impatience,
              and hubris.</p>
              <p>Wall grew up in Los Angeles and then Bremerton, Washington, before
              starting higher education at Seattle Pacific University in 1976, majoring
              in chemistry and music and later pre-medicine with a hiatus of several
              years working in the university's computing center before graduating with
              a bachelor's degree in Natural and Artificial Languages.</p>
              <p>While in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley,
                Wall and his wife were studying linguistics with the intention of
                finding an unwritten language, perhaps in Africa, and creating a 
                writing system for it. They would then use this new writing system
                to translate various texts into the language, among them the Bible. 
                Due to health reasons these plans were cancelled, and they remained
                in the United States, where Wall instead joined the NASA Jet Propulsion
                Laboratory after he finished graduate school. Wall is an active member
                of the New Life, Church of the Nazarene.</p>
              <p> <h3>About Larry.... </h3>
                <ul>
                <li>He has a sarcastic sense of humour.</li>
                <li>He eats all kinds of things for breakfast—but he eats breakfast at lunchtime.</li>
                <li>Wall's has a strong Christian faith and thus the terminology of Perl,
                such as the name itself is a biblical reference to the "pearl of great price".</li>
