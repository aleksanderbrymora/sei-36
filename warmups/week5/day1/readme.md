# Simple Sums - Ruby

## Instructions

Write a program that can calculate the sum of the first n elements of the following sequences:

```ruby
s1 = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + //etc
s2 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + //etc
```

## Example

```ruby
s1(4) = 0
s2(4) = 10
```

## Bonus

```ruby
s3 = 1 * (-2) * 3 * (-4) * 5  //etc

s3(4) = 24
```
