          <h2>Journey to Perl</h2>
          <p>The beginnings of Perl were directly inspired by running into a problem I couldn't solve with the tools I had. Or rather, that I couldn't easily solve. As the Apostle Paul so succinctly put it, “All things are possible, but not all things are expedient.” I could have solved my problem with awk and shell eventually, but I possess a fortuitous surplus of the three chief virtues of a programmer: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. I was too lazy to do it in awk because it would have been hard to get awk to jump through the hoops I was wanting it to jump through. I was too impatient to wait for awk to finish because it was so slow. And finally, I had the hubris to think I could do better.
          Of course, actually writing something like Perl takes a great deal of hard work, patience and even humility. Had I just been doing it for myself, I probably wouldn't have made the effort. However, I was aware from the beginning that other people were going to be using Perl, so I've always integrated the “laziness curve” over the whole community, not just over myself. I was being vicariously lazy. So here we are talking about vicars again.
          Eventually I came up with the name “pearl”, with the gloss Practical Extraction and Report Language. The “a” was still in the name when I made that one up. But I heard rumors of some obscure graphics language named “pearl”, so I shortened it to “perl”. (The “a” had already disappeared by the time I gave Perl its alternate gloss, Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.)</p>
          <p>
              In Perl's case, we realized about the time of Perl 4 that it was useful to distinguish between “perl” the program and “Perl” the language. If you find a first edition of the Camel Book, you'll see that the title was Programming perl, with a small “p”. Nowadays, the title is Programming Perl.
          It was designed to evolve, to become more adaptive, as they say. 
          Right from the start, Perl was designed for change. This involves certain tradeoffs, some of which appear to be suboptimal to people who don't think the way I think. For instance, I wanted to be able to add new keywords to Perl without breaking old programs, so I put them into a separate namespace from variable names. This meant either variable names or keywords had to be marked somehow as special. 
          Perl better than other scripting languages such as Python and Eiffel :
          Perl is unique, not just among scripting languages, but among computer languages in general. It's the only computer language consciously and explicitly designed to be postmodern.
