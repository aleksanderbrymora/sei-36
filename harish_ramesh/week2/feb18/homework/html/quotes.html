    <h2>Some of Marshall McLuhan's quotes</h2>
    <ul class="quotes">
      <li>Advertising is an environmental striptease for a world of abundance.</li>
      <li>The business of the advertiser is to see that we go about our business with some magic spell or tune or slogan throbbing quietly in the background of our minds.</li>
      <li>Historians and archaeologists will one day discover that the ads of our time are the richest and most faithful reflections that any society ever made of its entire range of activities.</li>
      <li>Madison Avenue is a very powerful aggression against private consciousness. A demand that you yield your private consciousness to public manipulation.</li>
      <li>Ideally, advertising aims at the goal of a programmed harmony among all human impulses and aspirations and endeavors. Using handicraft methods, it stretches out toward the ultimate electronic goal of a collective consciousness.</li>
      <li>Affluence creates poverty.</li>
      <li>Good taste is the first refuge of the non-creative. It is the last-ditch stand of the artist.</li>
      <li>Art is anything you can get away with.</li>
      <li>The more the data banks record about each one of us, the less we exist.</li>
      <li>I think of art, at its most significant, as a DEW line, a Distant Early Warning system that can always be relied on to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Edmonton is a young city that loves any excuse to go out on the town, even in a snowstorm. And there's prime shopping, too. West Edmonton Mall is literally the size of a city and the Old Strathcona farmers market is famous for a reason.

Culture bug: Edmonton is home to North America’s oldest and largest Fringe Festival every summer. The Edmonton Folk Music Festival is recognized as one of the best in the world.
Winter wonders: Edmonton embraces winter. There are iced pathways to skate around  and castles made of icicles. Join some locals in skijoring. That’s when people train their pet dogs to pull them around on skis. It's the next best thing to dog-sledding.</p>

<h2 id="theory">Marshall McLuhan's Theory</h2>
<p class="message">McLuhan uses the term 'message' to signify content and character. The content of the medium is a message that can be easily grasped and the character of the medium is another message which can be easily overlooked. McLuhan says "Indeed, it is only too typical that the 'content' of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium." For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action."[2] Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure."[3] Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations."[3] Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium"[4] – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.<br>

McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message," changing it to "mass age," "mess age," and "massage." A later book, The Medium Is the Massage was originally to be titled The Medium is the Message, but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a printing error.[citation needed]<br>

Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote:<br>

The title "The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There's a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, 'Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.' This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title."[5]<br>

It means that the nature of a medium (the channel through which a message is transmitted) is more important than the meaning or content of the message.<br>

McLuhan tells us that a "message" is, "the change of scale or pace or pattern" that a new invention or innovation "introduces into human affairs."<br>

McLuhan understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."[4] Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself (the content), and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.<br>

In Understanding Media, McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind.[8] This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are introduced subtly, or over long periods of time.[7] As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium. These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions that we are not aware of.<br>

On the subject of art history, McLuhan interpreted Cubism as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole"[9] rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content),[9] but rather consider it in its entirety.<br>

Canadian Universalist minister and theologian Angus MacLean coined the phrase “The method is the message” several years before McLuhan put “The medium is the message” in print. It is a corollary to McLuhan's work: "asserting that how religion is taught is more important than what is taught."</p>
