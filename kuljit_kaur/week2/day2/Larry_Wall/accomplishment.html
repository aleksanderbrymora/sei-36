        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p><img class="accomplish" src="images/larry_wall_1.jpeg" alt="Larry Wall Picture" align="left">Wall is the author of the rn Usenet client and the widely used patch 
          program. He has <span> won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest twice </span>
          and was the recipient of the first Free Software Foundation Award for
          the Advancement of Free Software in 1998.</p>
          <p>
            Wall <span>developed the Perl interpreter and language </span>while
            working for System Development Corporation, which later became part
            of Unisys.He is the co-author of Programming Perl (often referred to
            as the Camel Book and published by O'Reilly), which is the definitive
            resource for Perl programmers; and edited the Perl Cookbook. He then
            became employed full-time by O'Reilly Media to further develop Perl
            and write books on the subject.</p>
          <p>
            <span>Wall's training as a linguist is apparent in his books, interviews,
            and lectures.</span> He often compares Perl to a natural language and
            explains his decisions in Perl's design with linguistic rationale.
            He also often uses linguistic terms for Perl language constructs,
            so instead of traditional terms such as "variable", "function", and
             "accessor" he sometimes says "noun", "verb", and "topicalizer".
             <span>Wall's Christian faith has influenced some of the terminology of Perl,
             such as the name itself, a biblical reference to the "pearl of great price".</span>
             Similar references are the function name bless, and the organization
             of Raku (previously known as Perl 6 design documents with categories
             such as apocalypse and exegesis. Wall has also alluded to his faith
             when he has spoken at conferences, including August 23, 1999 at the
            Perl Conference 3.0 in Monterey, CA.</p>
            <p>
            Wall continues to oversee further development of Perl and serves as
            the benevolent dictator for life of the Perl project. The official
            Perl documentation states that:
            <ol>
            <li> Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should behave.
              This means he has final veto power on the core functionality.
            <li> Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a later
              date, regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule 1.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
