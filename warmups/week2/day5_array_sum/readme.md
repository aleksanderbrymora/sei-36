# Sum of arrays

Write a function that receives two arguments, both of which are Arrays and sums them. These arrays contain only numbers.
You don't know their length and they can contain both integers and floating point numbers.

## Example

[2, 6.4, 3] + [3, 3.6, 2] = 20
sum([2, 6.4, 3], [3, 3.6, 2]) => 20

## Bonus

Sum all of the arrays that are passed into the function.
sum([2, 6.4, 3], [3, 3.6, 2], [2, 6.4, 3], [3, 3.6, 2]) => 40
OR
sum([[2, 6.4, 3], [3, 3.6, 2], [2, 6.4, 3], [3, 3.6, 2]]) => 40
