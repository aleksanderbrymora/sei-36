<h2>ARM</h2>
  <p class=ach-p>Regardless of the technology you are using to read this post, you need to know that its processor was early designed by a trans woman named Sophie Wilson. The ARM microprocessor core is now used in thousands of different products, including smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles and broadband routers. Because of this, the British engineer Sophie Wilson is said to be one of the architects of the modern world.</p>

  <p class=ach-p>Some 35 years ago, the Acorn RISC Machine or ARM was built. Steve Furber focused on the hardware architecture and Sophie Wilson designed the instruction set for one of the first RISC processor. The ARM1 was a tiny, low-power, efficient 32-bit CPU with about 25,000 transistors using a 3 micron process. This was truly a milestone in British engineering.</p>

  <p class=ach-p>With the 6502 processor the fastest operation was done in two clock cycles (one microsecond). With the ARM1 32-bit operations could be done much quicker. But, the ARM1 didn’t have less instructions than the 6502, it was the complexity on how the instructions were implemented that was reduced.</p>

  <p class=ach-p>There wasn’t a unique microprocessor company in the world, there were a number of them producing RISC powered machines and there was a lot of creativity in the market. But everybody was concentrating on high execution throughputs by increasing the complexity of instructions that tended to slow down processors. With high-level design choices and assigning a limited set of simple instructions Sophie made them perform better with less power and at a lower price.</p>
