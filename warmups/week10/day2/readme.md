# Steve Yegge's Famous Code Test Questions Part I

1. Write a function to reverse a string.
1. Write function to print the odd numbers from 1 to 99.
1. Find the largest int value in an int array.
1. Write function to compute Nth fibonacci number.

You may be asked to solve this with or without standard libraries, so try to produce both kinds of solutions for practice.

These kinds of questions also give you a good chance to practice/demonstrate your grasp of TDD, so consider writing little test suites for each problem. You might like to experiment with methods like https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/assert if you're using JS.

> Some properties of a good weeder phone-screen coding question are:
> It's simple. It has to be something that you should be able to solve, trivially, in about 2 minutes or less. Not too tricky. Basic stuff.
> You've solved it. You shouldn't ask a question unless you've solved it yourself recently, so you know it's a reasonable question, and you can evaluate their answer to it. You should consider coding it yourself during the time you've given them to do it.
> It has loops or recursion. Recursion is actually preferable. Being able to reason recursively or inductively is important for many areas of computing, including using heirarchical data representations (e.g. XML), distributed computing, searching, and sorting. Many candidates simply can't think recursively, and this often goes undetected until interview-time. Try to find out at compile-time! Er, phone-screen time, that is.
> It has formatted output. This is a basic skill, useful for debugging, simple report generation, and lots of other things. "printf" is a universal standard; it exists in C, C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, Python, and virtually every other mainstream language, at least as a library call. Like file I/O, it's a good indicator as to whether the candidate has written "real" code before.
> It has text-file I/O. Candidates who have worked in frameworks for too long often become unable to function as programmers outside that framework. Not being able to do simple file I/O is a common indicator that they've grown overly dependent on a particular framework.
