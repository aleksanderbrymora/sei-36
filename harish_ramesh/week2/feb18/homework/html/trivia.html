  <h2>Things you should know about Marshall McLuhan</h2>
  <p>Marshall McLuhan, the famous professor and philosopher who predicted the Internet 30 years before it was invented, is the subject of the July 21 Google Doodle. McLuhan would have celebrated his 106th birthday today.

McLuhan was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on July 21, 1911 and died on December 31, 1980 in Toronto, a little over a year after suffering a stroke. He never got to experience the World Wide Web he predicted.

McLuhan was a rare public intellectual, whose work reached beyond academia and into popular culture. He developed unique philosophies on media and how humans interact with it, popularizing the phrases “The medium is the message” and “Global Village.”<br>“Long before we started looking to our screens for all the answers, Marshall McLuhan saw the internet coming — and predicted just how much impact it would have,” Google notes. “A Canadian philosopher and professor who specialized in media theory, McLuhan came to prominence in the 1960s, just as TV was becoming part of everyday life. At the center of his thinking was the idea that society is shaped by technology and the way information is shared.”</p>
